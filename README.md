DBPediaLinkSameAs
=================

 The main idea is to provide a service that can normalize any URI to a DBpedia identifier. This can be a standalone service for anyone to use of embedded in other components such as NIF. In the NIF case, outputs from different tools provide identifiers from different datasets (Freebase, Wikidata, etc). With our service we will take the NIF output and normalize all resources to DBpedia, in this case the results can be comparable.
